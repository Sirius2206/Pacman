# Pacman

The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding colored ghosts. Eating large dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn gray, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.

Gamefield can be easily edited via editing the 'map' const in the index.js:

[p] - player;

[.] - pellet;

[u] - power pellet (upgrade);

[g] - ghost;

[1], [2], [3], [4], [^], [<], [_], [>], [-], [|], [x] - different variations of obstacles.


Controls: WASD.
